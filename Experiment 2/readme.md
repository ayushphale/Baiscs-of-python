🐍 PYTHON PROGRAMMING LAB 📌 Title of the Experiment

Study of Basics of Python Programming

🎯 Aim

The aim of this experiment is to study and understand the fundamental concepts of the Python programming language. This includes learning basic syntax, variables, data types, operators, input/output statements, control structures, and functions to build a strong programming foundation.

🛠️ Software and Tools Required

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS

IDE / Editor: IDLE, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm

System Requirements: Minimum 2 GB RAM and basic processor

📘 Theory

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It is known for its simple syntax and readability, making it easy to learn and use.

Python programs are executed line by line using an interpreter, which simplifies debugging and program development. Python supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Basic Concepts of Python

Variables: Variables are used to store data values in memory. Python does not require explicit declaration of data types.

x = 10 name = "Python"

Data Types: Python supports various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

Operators: Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. These include arithmetic operators, relational operators, and logical operators.

Input and Output Statements: The input() function is used to accept input from the user, while the print() function is used to display output.

name = input("Enter your name: ") print("Hello", name)

Control Statements: Control statements determine the flow of execution of a program. Python provides conditional statements (if, elif, else) and looping statements (for, while).

Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code defined using the def keyword. They help in reducing code repetition and improving readability. ** 🧪 Procedure**

Install Python 3.x on the system.

Open the Python IDE or editor.

Write basic Python programs demonstrating different concepts.

Execute the programs and observe the output.

Modify the programs to understand the behavior of Python statements.

✅ Result

The basics of Python programming, including variables, data types, operators, input/output statements, control statements, and functions, were successfully studied and executed. ** 🏁 Conclusion ** Python is a simple and powerful programming language suitable for beginners. Learning its basic concepts helps in developing logical thinking and serves as a foundation for advanced programming and real-world applications.
