Conditional Statements
<div align="center"> <h1>🔀 CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS IN PYTHON</h1> <h3>Decision Making & Control Flow</h3> </div>
<h2>What are Conditional Statements?</h2>

Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions based on certain conditions.

They control the flow of execution by running specific blocks of code only when conditions are met.

They are fundamental in:

Program Logic

Input Validation

Game Development

Automation Scripts

Real-World Decision Systems

Understanding conditionals is essential for writing dynamic and interactive programs.

<h1>Core Conditional Structures</h1> <h2>1. if Statement</h2>

The <b>if</b> statement executes a block of code only when a condition evaluates to True.

<h3>When to Use</h3>

Checking a single condition

Validating user input

Making simple decisions

<h2>2. if-else Statement</h2>

The <b>if-else</b> structure provides an alternative block of code when the condition is False.

<h3>When to Use</h3>

Choosing between two outcomes

Basic decision-making scenarios

Handling true/false cases

<h2>3. if-elif-else Statement</h2>

This structure allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.

<h3>When to Use</h3>

Grading systems

Menu-based programs

Categorizing values

Multiple decision paths

<h1>Comparison Operators</h1>

Conditional statements often use comparison operators such as:

Equal to

Not equal to

Greater than

Less than

Greater than or equal to

Less than or equal to

These operators compare values and return True or False.

<h1>Logical Operators</h1>

Logical operators combine multiple conditions.

<h3>Main Logical Operators</h3>

AND → Both conditions must be True

OR → At least one condition must be True

NOT → Reverses the condition result

They help create more complex decision-making logic.

<h1>Nested Conditionals</h1>

A nested conditional is a conditional statement inside another conditional.

<h3>Used For</h3>

Multi-level decision systems

Authentication logic

Advanced rule checking

Nested structures should be written clearly to maintain readability.

<h1>Practical Applications</h1>

Conditional statements are used in:

Login systems

ATM simulations

Grading systems

E-commerce checkout validation

Game score evaluation

They allow programs to behave intelligently based on input or conditions.

<h1>Best Practices</h1>

Keep conditions clear and readable

Avoid deeply nested structures when possible

Use logical operators efficiently

Write meaningful condition checks

Test all possible scenarios

<div align="center"> <h2>Final Thought</h2>

Conditional statements are the backbone of program logic.
Mastering them enables you to build interactive and intelligent Python applications.
