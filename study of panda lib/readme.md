# 🏗️ Core Data Structures

## 1️⃣ Series

A **one-dimensional labeled array** capable of holding any data type such as integers, strings, or floats.

Think of it as a single column in a spreadsheet.

---

## 2️⃣ DataFrame

A **two-dimensional labeled data structure** with rows and columns.

It is similar to:
- 📑 Excel spreadsheets  
- 🗃️ SQL tables  
- 📊 Structured datasets  

This is the most commonly used structure in Pandas.
